\subsection{Standard Model Diboson}
\label{sec:Bkg:diboson}

Standard Model dibosons consist of approximately 1 percent of the background in the SR.  The diboson background consist of less then 2 percent of any single $\RISR$ bin in the SR.  The background is negligible and we only use MC predictions for background estimation.
