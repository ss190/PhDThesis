\subsection{Standard Model \ttbar+Z}
\label{sec:Bkg:ttV}

$\ttbar$ produced in conjunction with a Z boson consist of about 1 percent of the background in the SR.  Although the background is essentially negligible we do estimate the amount of $\ttbar+\Zboson$ using a $\ttbar+\gamma$ CR. Designing a CR to estimate the $\ttbar+Z$ background by using the charged leptonic $Z$ boson decays would be favorable. However, such CR is difficult to design due to low statistics and the small branching fraction to leptons. In particular a 2-lepton CR suffers from a large contamination of $\ttbar$ and $Z$ + jets processes. For this reason, another data driven approach is followed by building a one-lepton CR for $\ttbar\gamma$ which is a similar process. A zero-lepton region was considered as a validation region but it was found to have a too low $\ttbar\gamma$ contribution, with $\gamma$+jets being the main contaminant.\\
The CR is designed to minimize the differences between the two processes and keep the theoretical uncertainties from the extrapolation of the $\gamma$ to the \Zboson\ low. \\

The $\ttbar+\gamma$ CR requires exactly one photon with a FixedCutTight isolation WP, exactly one signal lepton (electron or muon as defined in Section~\ref{sec:Selection}) and at least four jets of which at least two are required to be b-tagged. To collect these events the lepton triggers described in Table~\ref{tb:lepTriggers} are used. \\
Moreover, due to the difference in mass between the \Zboson\ and the $\gamma$, to mimic the $Z \rightarrow \nu\nu$ decay, the highest \pT\ photon is required to have $\pt>150\gev$. \\ %A k-factor equal to 1.47~\cite{ATLAS:xsecNLOttV} is applied to $\ttbar\gamma$. 
Unlike the CRTops, CRW, and CRST one-lepton control regions the lepton is not treated as a jet. Instead, the photon is used to model the \met\ since the \met\ from $\ttbar+Z$ in the SR originates mostly from the neutrino decay of the \Zboson. \\
The details of the selection for the one-lepton CR are summarized in Table~\ref{tb:ttG_1lepSel}.\\

Table~\ref{tb:ttVCR_2bj} shows the background composition for the $\ttbar\gamma$ CR. A normalisation factor is derived as the ratio between data and MC correcting for the contamination for non-$t\bar{t}\gamma$ backgrounds.
