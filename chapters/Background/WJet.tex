\subsection{Standard Model W+Jets}
\label{sec:Bkg:wjet}

\indent A $W$ boson produced in conjunction with QCD jets ($W$+jets) consists our largest sub-dominant background.  $W$+jets makes up 5 percent of the total background in the SR.  However the distribution of $W$+jets is not uniform across $\RISR$.  $W$+jets can reach around 15 percent of all background in the SR bins with the largest $\RISR$.  This means the $W$+jets contribution mostly affects high stop mass samples because those signal samples peak at high $\RISR$. \\

\indent We estimate $W$+Jets using an one lepton control region defined in table \ref{tab:WJetCR}..  The one lepton $W$+jet CR is designed to ensure high $W$+jet purity.   All one lepton CRs are mutually exclusive including the ttbar, $W$+jets and single top CR. \\

  \label{tab:WJetCR}
\end{table}

\indent The {\tt Signal} lepton is treated as a jet for the jet multiplicity and the jet $\pt$ requirements.  The mass requirement on the large R jet $\mantikttwelvezero < 60 \gev$ rejects events with reconstructed boosted tops.  The $\mtlepmet$ selection ensures that the transverse mass is consistent with those originating from a $W$ boson.  \\

\indent Orthogonality between the $W$+jet CR and the single top CR is ensured by the requirement on the number of $b$-jets.  Orthogonality between ttbar CR and $W$+jet CR is ensured by the selection on $\Delta R(b_{0,1},\ell)_{\mathrm{min}}$, defined as the minimum $\Delta R$ between the two jets with the highest b-tag value and the selected lepton.  \\

\indent  Distributions of select kinematic variables in the $\Wjets$ control region are shown in figure ~\ref{fig:CRWpts}.  The MC background has been normalized to data by performing a simultaneous fit to all CRs.  The hashed bands on the total SM background correspond to the total experimental systematical uncertainty plus the MC statistical uncertainty.  The yield in the $\Wjets$ CR is given in table~\ref{tab:CRW_yields}.  \\

\indent  Data and MC are compatible to within statistical uncertainty.  No strong trends are observed in the data to MC ratios in any of the distributions. \\
