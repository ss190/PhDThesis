\subsection{Standard Model W+Jets}
\label{sec:Bkg:wjet}

\indent A $W$ boson produced in conjunction with QCD jets ($W$+jets) is our largest subdominant background.  $W$+jets comprises 9 percent of the total background in the signal region.  However the distribution of $W$+jets is not uniform across $\RISR$.  $W$+jets can reach 20-25 percent of all backgrounds in signal region bins with the largest $\RISR$.  This means the $W$+jets contribution mostly affects high stop mass samples because those signal samples peak at high $\RISR$. \\

\indent We estimate $W$+jets using an one lepton control region defined in table \ref{tab:WJetCR}..  The one lepton $W$+jet control region is designed to ensure high $W$+jet purity.   All one lepton control regions are mutually exclusive including the ttbar, $W$+jets and single top control region. \\

  \caption{Summary of the selection for the one lepton $W$+jets control region.}
  \label{tab:WJetCR}
\end{table}

\indent The lepton is treated as a jet for the jet multiplicity and the jet $\pt$ requirements.  Similar to the one lepton $\ttbar$ control region, the lepton is meant to play the role of a hadronic tau jet in the zero-lepton signal region.  \\

\indent $\mtlepmet$ is defined in equation \ref{eqn:mtlep} as the transverse mass of the lepton and the $\met$.  The $\mtlepmet$ selection ensures that the transverse mass is consistent with those originating from a $W$ boson.  \\

\indent Orthogonality between the $W$+jet control region and the single top control region is ensured by the requirement on the number of $b$-jets.  Orthogonality between $\ttbar$ control region and $W$+jet control region is ensured by the selection on $\mindrblep$.  $\mindrblep$ is defined in equation \ref{eqn:mindrblep} as the minimum $\Delta R$ between the two jets with the highest b-tag value and the selected lepton. \\

\indent $\mantikttwelvezero$ is defined as the mass of an $\antikt$ jet built with a distance parameter of $R=1.2$ instead of regular $R=0.4$.  The $\antikt$ algorithm clusters calorimeter energy into a jet according to the distance metric $R$ and is covered in detail in section \ref{sec:jet:reco}.  The $\antikt$ algorithm will form a perfectly conical jet of radius $R$ if no other hard objects are found within a cone of $2R$.  If two hard objects exist within $R<\Delta R<2R$ of one another then two jets will be formed splitting the energy cells between them.  \\

\indent The large R=1.2 jet is designed to cluster all the energy of a boosted top quark into a single jet.  If the jet contains a boosted top, the invariant mass of jet should be close to $\sim m_t$. The $\mantikttwelvezero < 60 \gev$ is designed to reject events with reconstructed boosted tops.  \\

\indent  Distributions of select kinematic variables in the $\Wjets$ control region are shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:CRWpts}.  The MC background has been normalized to data by performing a simultaneous fit to all control regions.  The hashed bands on the total SM background correspond to the total experimental systematical uncertainty plus the MC statistical uncertainty.  The yield in the $\Wjets$ control region is given in Table~\ref{table.bkgonly.CRW}.  \\

\indent  The fitted $W$+jets normalization scale factor is $1.27 \pm 0.15$.  Data and MC are compatible to within statistical uncertainty.  No strong trends are observed in the data to MC ratios in any of the distributions. \\
