\subsection{Standard Model W+Jets}
\label{sec:Bkg:wjet}

\indent W boson produced in conjunction with QCD jets ($W$+jets) consists our largest sub-dominate background.  $W$+jets consists of 5 percent of the total background in the SR.  However the distribution of $W$+jets is not uniform across $\RISR$.  $W$+jets can reach around 15 percent of all background in the SR bins with the largest $\RISR$.  This means the $W$+jets contribution mostly affects the signal with high stop masses because those signal samples peak at high $\RISR$. \\

\indent We estimate $W$+Jets using a 1 lepton control region defined in section \ref{sec:WCR}.  The 1 lepton $W$+jet CR is orthogonal to the 1 lepton ttbar CR and 1 lepton single top CR defined in table \ref{tab:ttbar1LepCRISR_def} and \ref{tab:singleTop1LepCR_def} .  \\

\subsubsection{\Wjets\ Control Region}
\label{sec:WCR}

\indent The 1 lepton $W$+jet CR is designed to reject top events and ensure high $W$+jet purity.  The definition of the $W$+jets CR is given in table \ref{tab:WJetCR}. \\

\indent The signal lepton is treated as a jet for the jet multiplicity and the jet $\pt$ requirement as well as for the top reconstruction.The mass requirement on the large R jet $\mantikttwelvezero < 60 \gev$ rejects events with reconstructed boosted tops.  The $\mtlepmet$ selection ensures that the transverse mass is consistent with those originating from a $W$ boson.  \\

\indent Orthogonality between $W$+jet CR and the single top CR is ensured by the requirement on the number of $b$-jets.  Orthogonality between ttbar CR and $W$+jet CR is ensured by the selection on $\Delta R(b_{0,1},\ell)_{\mathrm{min}}$, defined as the minimum $\Delta R$ between the two jets with the highest b-tag value and the selected lepton.  The signal contamination is less than 10\% for all signal points.  \\

\indent Data vs MC comparisons in the $\Wjets$ control region are shown in histograms in figure ~\ref{fig:CRWpts}.  The expected MC background has been normalized to the amount of data in the $\Wjets$ control region by performing a simultaneous fit to all background CR.  The hashed bands on the total SM background correspond to the amount of total experimental systematical uncertainty plus the MC statistical uncertainty.  The yield in the $\Wjets$ CR is given in table~\ref{tab:CRW_yields}.  \\

\indent  Data and MC are compatible to within statistical uncertainty.  No strong trends are observed in the data to MC ratios in any of the distribution. \\
