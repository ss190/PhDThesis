\section{Common Background Estimation and Validation Techniques}
\label{sec:Bkg:Tech}

\indent We use both data and MC based background estimation technique for estimating background in the signal region.  A common partially data driven technique is by using different control regions (CR) to directly measure the amount of background from data.  Once we know the amount of background in the CR, we can then extrapolate to the signal region using MC predictions of the relative amount of background in CR and SR. 

\indent The total amount of background is determined through a simultaneous fit to SR and all CRs.  The background rate will be mainly constrained by the CRs because the CR contain many more events the SR and is pure in specific types of background.  A more detailed explanation of CR, SR and fits are covered in the statistical analysis section \ref{sec:stat:Bkg}.  \\

\indent Aside from the fitting to control regions, we can get a simplified estimate of the amount of background in the SR through a simpler method.  We can calculate the transfer factor and normalization factor defined in equation \ref{eqn:TF} and \ref{eqn:mu}. This simplified result may slightly differ for the combined fit but should be similar as long as the CRs are well designed and consists mainly of a single type of background. \\

\begin{equation}
T = \frac{N_{MC}^{SR}}{N_{MC}^{CR}}
\label{eqn:TF}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mu_{MC} = \frac{N_{data}^{CR}-N_{non-ttbar MC}^{CR}}{N_{ttbar~MC}^{CR}}
\label{eqn:mu}
\end{equation}

\indent We normalize the ttbar MC in the ttbar CR to the amount of data with a normalization scale factor $\mu$ defined in equation \ref{eqn:mu}.  We then apply the transfer factor to predict the amount of ttbar we expect to see in the SR.  This is mathematically equivalent to simply normalizing the amount of ttbar MC in the SR by the scale factor derived in the CR because the transfer factor is the just the relative rates of MC in the SR and CR.   \\
\indent We use control regions to estimate the dominant ttbar background and subdominant W+jet, single top, and ttV backgrounds.  Z+jets and diboson backgrounds are estimated using MC alone.  Z+jets and diboson contributions are less then 5 percent of all backgrounds in the SR and we allow for an additional 100 percent theory uncertainty for these two samples.  Details on the ttbar background is found in section \ref{sec:Bkg:ttbar}. Details on the treatment of each sub dominate background can be found in section \ref{sec:Bkg:sub}. Finally QCD multijet background is estimated using the jet smearing method described in section \ref{sec:Bkg:QCD}.
