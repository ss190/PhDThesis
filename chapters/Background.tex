\section{Common Background Estimation and Validation Techniques}
\label{sec:Bkg:Tech}

\indent We use both data and MC based background estimation technique for estimating background in the signal region.  A common partially data driven technique directly measures the amount of background in kinematically similar control regions (CR) in data.  Once we know the amount of background in the CR, we can then extrapolate to the signal region using MC predictions. \\

\indent We determined the background rate through a simultaneous fit to all SR and CRs when setting limits or calculating discovery significances.  The background rate will be mainly constrained by the CRs because the CRs have significantly higher statistics then SR.  \\

\indent We also perform a background only fit to estimate the background rates.  The background only fit extracts a normalization factor for each background by simultaneously fit all control regions.  The normalization factors are then applied to the expected background rates in SR.  The background only fit results may differ from the combined fit. However the two estimate should be similar as long as the CRs are well designed.   A more detailed explanation of CR, SR and fitting procedures are covered in the statistical analysis chapter \ref{chap:statistics}.  \\

%\indent We can get a quick estimate of the amount of background in the SR by calculating the transfer factor and normalization factor defined in equation \ref{eqn:TF} and \ref{eqn:mu}. \\

%\begin{equation}
%T = \frac{N_{MC}^{SR}}{N_{MC}^{CR}}
%\label{eqn:TF}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\mu_{MC} = \frac{N_{data}^{CR}-N_{non-ttbar MC}^{CR}}{N_{ttbar~MC}^{CR}}
%\label{eqn:mu}
%\end{equation}

%\indent We normalize the MC in CR to data with a normalization scale factor $\mu$ defined in equation \ref{eqn:mu}.  We then apply the transfer factor to predict the amount of ttbar we expect to see in the SR.  This is mathematically equivalent to simply normalizing the amount of ttbar MC in the SR by the scale factor derived in the CR because the transfer factor is the just the relative rates of MC in the SR and CR.   \\

%\indent This simplified result may differ slightly from the combined fit.  However the two estimate should be similar as long as the CRs are well designed and consists mainly of a single type of background. \\

\indent We use control regions to estimate the dominant ttbar background and subdominant W+jet, single top, and ttV backgrounds.  Z+jets and diboson backgrounds are estimated using MC alone.  Z+jets and dibosons contribute less then 5 percent of all backgrounds in the SR and we allow for an additional 100 percent theory uncertainty for these two samples.   Finally QCD multijet background is estimated using the jet smearing method described in section \ref{sec:Bkg:QCD}. Details on the ttbar background is found in section \ref{sec:Bkg:ttbar}. Details on the treatment of each sub dominate background can be found in section \ref{sec:Bkg:sub}.\\

\indent The scale factors for each background derived from the simultaneous fit to the CR are given in table \ref{table.scale.factors}. ttbar background is scaled down by 0.707 because the MC over estimates the amount of ttbar that is produced with strong ISR. \\
