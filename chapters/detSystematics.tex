\section{Experimental Uncertainties}
\label{sec:ExpSystematics}

%\indent Experimental systematics are estimated using a simultaneous fit of the control region and the results extrapolated to the signal region in a background only fit.  Variations on MC background yield and kinematics are determined by different object performance groups using a number of simulation based and data driven in-situ techniques.  A simultaneous fit to the control region gives the best fit value of the systematic parameter $\alpha$ and the systematic uncertainty associated with the background prediction in the signal region. \\

\subsection{Uncertainties on the Jet Energy Scale and Jet Energy Resolution } 

\indent The two main uncertainties affecting jet measurements are the uncertainties from jet energy scale and jet energy resolution calibrations. The jet reconstruction and calibration process is described in section \ref{sec:reco:jets}.  Uncertainty in the calibration process leads to uncertainty in the calorimeter response. \\

\indent Jet energy scale uncertainties are derived from different in-situ techniques by the ATLAS Jet/$\met$ group.  These techniques exploit the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon, a Z boson, or another jet.\cite{JES_dijet, JES_ZGamma}.  The jet energy scale uncertainty depends on $\eta$ and $\pt$ of the jet.  Uncertainties related to jet flavor composition and pile-up are also included.  \\

\indent  The $\ttbar$ control region requires similar jet multiplicity and jet energy as the signal region.  Therefore, much of the jet energy scale and jet energy resolution uncertainties are canceled out in the transfer factor between the control and signal regions.  Even after the cancelations, the jet energy scale uncertainty contributes a $\sim10$\% uncertainty to background yields and is one the major systematic uncertainties in this analysis.  \\

%\indent jet energy scale Uncertainty can be parameterized as a combination of 77 nuisance parameters.  This full set of nuisance parameter was combined to give a set of only 4 nuisance parameters.  The distribution of jets showed no dependence on the choice of full or reduced parameter set. \\

\indent The fractional jet energy scale uncertainty as a function of $\eta$ and $\pt$ for 2016 data can be see in Figures \ref{fig:sys:JES1} and \ref{fig:sys:JES2}. \\

\indent Uncertainties on the jet energy resolution are derived from dijet balance techniques.\cite{JES_dijet}  The fractional uncertainty on jet energy resolution as a function of $\eta$ and $\pt$ can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:sys:JER1} and \ref{fig:sys:JER2}. \\

\subsection{Uncertainty on $b$-tagging Efficiency}

\indent  The $b$-tagging uncertainty is derived by the ATLAS flavor-tagging working group.  A separate set of weights are applied for each set of $b$-tagging variations.  These include scale factors on $b$-tagging efficiencies and the rate of mis-tagging of $c$-jets and light-flavored jets. The b-tagging efficiency uncertainty as a function of jet $\pt$ in $\ttbar$ is shown as the green shaded region in Figure \ref{fig:sys:btag}. \\

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/JetCalib/MV20c10_btaggingEff.eps}
\caption[Ratio of b-tagging efficiency in data and MC between data and MC.]{Ratio of b-tagging efficiency in data and Monte Carlo for the MV2c10 b-tagging algorithm at the 77\% working point as a function of jet $\pt$. The b-tagging efficiency was extracted from a $\ttbar$ enriched region. Statistical errors (black lines) and total errors (green shaded region) are shown. The bin below a $\pt$ of $30\gev$ has large uncertainties.}
\label{fig:sys:btag}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\indent The uncertainty on $b$-tagging does not contribute a large systematic uncertainty to our analysis because we only require one b-tagged jet with $\pt > 40 \gev$.  The $\pt > 40 \gev$ requirement avoids the large uncertainty on $b$-tagging efficiency at low $\pt$.  

\indent At the same time, there is little extrapolation between background control regions and the signal region. The $\ttbar$, $W$+jets and QCD multijets all use control regions that also require one $b$-tagged jet.  After fitting to control regions, $b$-tagging systematics amount to only a 1-3\% uncertainty on the total background rate in the signal region.  \\

\subsection{Uncertainty on the $\met$ Soft Term}

\indent The $\met$ is defined in equation \ref{eqn:metReco1} as the negative vector sum of all hard reconstructed objects and a ``soft term''.  Hard objects include reconstructed electrons, photons, jets, and muons.  The soft term is determined by summing over the $\pt$ of all ID tracks that aren't associated with any hard objects and is intend to estimate all the energy not associated with any hard reconstructed objects.  Although the soft term only registers the $\pt$ from charged objects, it is able to effectively reject any energy deposited by pile-up interactions because ID tracks can be associated with the hard interaction primary vertex. \\

\begin{equation}
\met = - ( \sum_{hard~objects} E_T + \sum_{soft} E_T ) 
\label{eqn:metReco1}
\end{equation}

\indent  The majority of the uncertainty on $\met$ has already been accounted for by systematics on other reconstructed objects because the $\met$ is built mostly out of fully calibrated and reconstructed physics objects.  However, there is one term in the $\met$ reconstruction that is independent of any hard reconstructed object; the $\met$ soft term or $\sum_{soft} E_T$.  The purpose of the $\met$ soft term is to take into account the $E_T$ from objects that are too soft to be reconstructed.  Therefore, the uncertainty on the $\met$ soft term forms an independent systematic uncertainty.  \\

\indent The uncertainty on the $\met$ soft term resolution and scale is derived by the ATLAS Jet/$\met$ group from two in-situ methods.  Both methods measures the amount of $\met$ in $Z\rightarrow \mu\mu$ events which are expect to contain little intrinsic $\met$.\cite{METPerform}  Hence, the reconstructed $\met$ is expected to come from mainly the $\met$ soft term, instead of an imbalance in hard reconstructed objects.  \\

\indent The uncertainty on the $\met$ track soft term (TST) vs the number of reconstructed primary vertexes in $\ttbar$ simulation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sys:MET_TST_tt}. \\

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/METCalib/MET_TST_tt.eps}
\caption[Uncertainty on the $\met$ track soft term as a function the number of reconstructed vertexes.]{Uncertainty on the $\met$ track soft term as a function the number of reconstructed vertexes.  More reconstructed vertexes means more pile-up interactions are in the event. }
\label{fig:sys:MET_TST_tt}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\indent The $\met$ soft term resolution and scale uncertainty contribute a $1-2\%$ uncertainty on the total background yield.  The small uncertainty result from the high $\met$ requirement of at least 250 $\gev$ and little to no extrapolation across $\met$ between the control and signal regions for all major backgrounds. \\

\subsection{Uncertainties on Lepton Reconstruction and Resolution}

\indent Uncertainties on lepton reconstruction and identification propagate to uncertainties on control and signal region yields.  These uncertainties include uncertainties on e/$\gamma$ resolution, energy scale, and reconstruction efficiency and muon momentum and reconstruction efficiency.  Lepton trigger scale factors are also taken into account for the $\ttbar+\gamma$ control region. \\

\indent These uncertainties are derived by the ATLAS E/$\gamma$ and muon combined performance groups and result in sub 1\% uncertainty on signal region yields.\cite{MuonReco,EleID} \\

\subsection{Pile-up Uncertainty}

\indent The uncertainty on the amount of pile-up in 2015 and 2016 ATLAS data is estimated using a two sided variation in event weights.  One set of weights simulates a lower rates of pile-up interactions and the other set simulates a higher rate.  Pile-up uncertainty contributes a 1-2\% uncertainty on the total background yield in the signal region.

%% \item{\bf \dphimettrk\ and tau veto}
%%   No additional uncertainty is assigned for the requirements on
%%   \dphimettrk\ and on the tau veto. Both were discussed extensively for
%%   the 7 \TeV\ analysis \cite{7TeVSupportNote} where no additional
%%   systematic was assigned.  There are currently no official
%%   recommendations from the jet/etmiss group for \mettrk.  For the 7
%%   \TeV\ analysis, Fig 42 in Appendix C showed good agreement between
%%   data and MC for \dphimettrk\ in the tau-veto-inverted validation
%%   region.  For the current analysis, Fig. \ref{fig:SRA_dataMC} shows
%%   good agreement for the \mettrk\ variables in a \ttbar\ dominated
%%   region.  Tau veto systematics are documented in Appendix D of the 7
%%   \TeV\ note.  Data/MC comparisons were made for several variables in
%%   the 1-lepton control region and in the tau-veto-inverted validation
%%   region.  The tau fake rate was determined in a $Z\nu\nu$+jets
%%   dominated sample to be around 12\%. The systematic on this fake rate
%%   was determined with a study of the track multiplicity in jets; the
%%   track multiplicity for ($n_{trk} \le 4$) showed agreement within 5\%
%%   between data and MC.
