\section{Interpretation of Results on Different Stop Models}
\label{chap:Interpretation}

\indent Since no significant excesses where observed in the signal region, the results are interpreted as exclusions on stop parameter space.  The 95 percent confidence expected and observed exclusion limit is shown in Figure \ref{figure.exclusion.SRC}.  The exclusion CL$_s$ are derived using the exclusion fit procedure described in section \ref{sec:stat:limit} where all 5 bins in $\RISR$ are simultaneously fitted and statistically combined. Previous 8 TeV stop exclusion limits are shown in blue for comparison. \\

Y-axis correspond to the mass splitting between stops and neutralinos $\Delta m = m_{\stop} - m_{\ninoone}$ and x-axis is the stop mass.  The solid blue and maroon curve correspond to the expected and observed 95\% confidence limit curve in the $\Delta m$, $m_{\stop}$ plane.  The region enclosed by the curves are excluded.  The dashed red line is the 95\% confidence limit on stop signal with a $1\sigma$ increase/decrease in signal production cross section.  The shaded yellow region correspond to the $1\sigma$ variation on the expected limit curve.  The best sensitivity is along the $\Delta m = m_t$ horizontal line.  95\% confidence limits extend to a wide range of $\Delta m$, close to the $\Delta m = m_W + m_b $ line at the bottom and upwards of $\Delta m > m_t+30 \gev $.  We are able to exclude stop masses between $225 \gev$ and $600 \gev$ if $\Delta m = m_t$.  The expected sensitivity of the analysis, quantified in terms of expected CL$_s$ values for different stop samples, are the numbers written on the histogram.  The location of the number on the $\Delta m$, $m_{\stop}$ plane corresponds to the stop, neutralino mass point for the expected CL$_s$ value.  }

\indent  The compressed stop analysis fills in the 8 TeV gap in exclusion along the $\Delta m = m_{t}$ diagonal line.  The analysis is able to exclude stops from $225 \gev$ to $600 \gev$ in this region with an expected CL$_s$ value below $5\times 10^{-4}$ for stop mass between 250 and 400 $\gev$.  The analysis also extends the zero lepton sensitivity far into the 3 body decay region almost to the $\Delta m = m_{W}+m_{b}$ line. \\

\indent Figure \ref{figure.exclusion.SRABC} shows the compressed stop analysis exclusion limit (SRC) combined with the bulk region 13 TeV stop 0 lepton analysis exclusion limit (SRA+SRB).  \\

\indent The bulk stop 0 lepton analysis targets the high stop masses parameter space with large mass splitting between stop and neutralino masses where the stop decay gives a large amount of momentum to the resulting neutralinos.  The bulk region analysis use large amount of $\met$ to separate signal from background and targets the stop, neutralino parameter space with large mass splitting.   Because of this, the bulk region analysis's strategy loses sensitivity as the $\Delta m$ approaches $m_{t}$.  A detail description of the bulk region stop 0 lepton analysis can be found in \cite{stop0Lmoriond}.  \\

\indent The bulk region analysis is sensitive to stop masses up $\sim900-1000 \gev$ if the neutralino mass is below $\sim350 \gev$. The compressed region analysis and adds sensitivity to the $\Delta m = m_{t}$ diagonal region where the bulk region analysis and the 8 TeV ATLAS stop searches lack sensitivity.  The exclusion limit for the compressed analysis and the bulk region analysis are combined by simply selecting the lowest CL$_s$ value at each stop, neutralino mass point.  No statistical combinations between the two analysis are made because the two analysis' signal regions are not orthogonal to one another. \\

All regions below the curve has been excluded to 95\% confidence.  The dashed red line is the 95\% confidence limit on stop signal with a $1\sigma$ increase/decrease in signal production cross section.  The shaded yellow region correspond to the $1\sigma$ variation on the expected limit curve.  The variation on the expected limit curve is derived by fitting independent toy experiments and deriving an envelope of confidence limits.  The 8 TeV ATLAS stop search 95\% confidence limits are shown as the shaded blue region in comparison.  The SRA and SRB analyses target high stop masses with large $\Delta m$ and medium amount of $\Delta m$.  Together these two analyses are sensitive to stop masses up $\sim900-1000 \gev$ if the neutralino mass is below $\sim350 \gev$. SRC correspond to the compressed region analysis and adds sensitivity to the $\Delta m = m_{t}$ diagonal region where SRA, SRB and the 8 TeV ATLAS stop searches lack sensitivity.   }

\indent Figure \ref{figure.exclusion.SRABCD_dm1} show how the exclusion limit on the stop/neutralino parameter space plane for different the branching fraction of $\stop \rightarrow t+\ninoone$ and $\stop \rightarrow b+\chinoonepm$.  As the $\stop \rightarrow t+\ninoone$ branching fraction decreases, the $\stop \rightarrow b+\chinoonepm$ branching fraction increases with total branching ratio of the two channels adding to one.  Sensitivity from another signal region {\tt SRD} that directly targets the mixed decay channel is combined with the compressed analysis (SRC) and the bulk region analyses (SRA+SRB).  Detailed documentation on the mixed decay analysis can also be found in \cite{stop0Lmoriond}.  Again the compressed analysis is responsible for the exclusion of all stop parameter space along the $\Delta m = m_{t}$ diagonal line when branching fraction to $\stop \rightarrow t+\ninoone$ is high. \\

                  The results are based on a combination of the compressed stop analysis (SRC) targeting $\stop\ra t\ninoone$ with $\Delta m = m_{\stop} - m_{\ninoone} = m_{t}$, the bulk region stop 0 lepton search (SRA+SRB) targeting $\stop\ra t\ninoone$ with $\Delta m >> m_{t}$, and the mixed decay stop search (SRD) targeting stops that decays via both the $\stop\ra t\ninoone$ and $\stop\ra b\chinoonepm$ channels.  The combination take the result from the analysis with the best
                  expected $CL_s$ for the stop, neutralino mass point and the specific decay fraction. 
                   We can see that the compressed analysis SRC adds sensitivity to the $\Delta m = m_t$ line when the branching fraction is mainly to $\stop\ra t\ninoone$.}
