\indent Since no significant excesses where observed in the signal region, the results are interpreted as exclusions on stop parameter space.  The 95\% confidence observed and expected exclusion limit is shown in figure \ref{figure.exclusion.SRC}.  The exclusion p-values are derived using the exclusion fit procedure described in section \ref{sec:stat:limit} where all 5 bins in $\RISR$ are simultaneously fitted and statistically combined. \\

\indent Previous 8 TeV stop exclusion limits are shown in blue for comparison. \\

\indent Figure \ref{figure.exclusion.SRABC} shows the compressed stop analysis exclusion limit combined with the bulk region 13 TeV stop 0 lepton analysis exclusion limit.  The bulk stop 0 lepton analysis targets the high stop masses parameter space with larger mass splitting between stop and neutralino masses.  In regions with large mass splitting between stop and neutralinos, the stop decay gives a large amount of momenta to the resulting neutralinos and therefore we expect a large of amount $\met$ in signal.  The bulk region analysis builds kinematic variables such as $m_{eff}$ that uses the large amount of $\met$ to separate signal from background.  A detail description of the bulk region stop 0 lepton analysis can be found here \cite{stop0Lmoriond}.  \\

\indent The compressed analysis is exclusively responsible for the exclusion of all stop masses from $225 \gev$ to $600 \gev$ along the $\Delta m = m_{t}$ diagonal line.  We can see the bulk region analysis's sensitivity decrease as the  $\Delta m$ decrease to $\sim m_{t}$.  \\

		\caption{Results of the exclusion fits in the tN1 grid from the combination of the bulk region stop 0L analysis (SRA+SRB) and the compressed analysis (SRC). The bulk region analysis SRA targets high stop masses with large $\Delta m$ and SRB targets high stop masses with medium amount of $\Delta m$.  SRC is the compressed region analysis and adds sensitivity to the $\Delta m = m_{t}$ diagonal region where SRA and SRB lack sensitivity. }

\indent Figure \ref{figure.exclusion.SRABCD_dm1} show how the exclusion limit on the stop, neutralino parameter space plane as the branching fraction to $\stop \rightarrow t+\ninoone$ change from 100\% to 0\%.  As the $\stop \rightarrow t+\ninoone$ branching fraction decreases, the $\stop \rightarrow b+\chinoonepm$ branching fraction increases.  Another signal region directly targeting the $\stop \rightarrow b+\chinoonepm$ decay channel {\it SRD} is added.  Detailed documentation on the mixed decay analysis can also be found in \cite{stop0Lmoriond}. \\

\indent Again the compressed analysis is exclusively responsible for the exclusion of all stop parameter space along the $\Delta m = m_{t}$ diagonal line when branching fraction to $\stop \rightarrow t+\ninoone$ is high. \\

		\caption{Results of the exclusion fits in the grid
                  with two stop decay channels: $\stop\ra t\ninoone$
                  and $\stop\ra b\chinoonepm\ra b
                  W^{(*)}\ninoone$, with $m(\chinoonepm)-m(\ninoone) =
                  1 GeV$.  The results are shown as a function of the
                  branching ratio to $\stop\ra t\ninoone$: 0\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\% and 100\%.  
                  The results are based on taking the signal region with the best
                  expected $CL_s$, using SRA, SRB, SRC, and SRD.
                  SRA and SRB target high stop masses in the  $\stop\ra t\ninoone$ decay channel at high stop masses and moderate to large $\Delta m$.  SRC is the compressed region analysis that targets  $\stop\ra t\ninoone$ with $\Delta m \sim m_t$.  SRD targets a mix decay channel with branching fraction to both  $\stop\ra t\ninoone$ and $\stop\ra b\chinoonepm\ra b W^{(*)}\ninoone$.  We can see that the compressed analysis SRC adds sensitivity to the $\Delta m = m_t$ line when the branching fraction is mainly to $\stop\ra t\ninoone$.}
