\label{chap:Uncertainties}

%Systematic uncertainties are associated with the predictions of all background components and the expected signal yields. The systematic uncertainties can be categorized into two sources: experimental and theoretical uncertainties. These systematic uncertainties can impact the expected event yields in the control and signal region as well as the transfer factors used when extrapolating the background expectation from the control to the signal region.

%This section overviews the systematic uncertainties considered and their determination in Sections~\ref{sec:ExpSystematics} and ~\ref{sec:TheoSystematics}, and the size in Section~\ref{sec:sizeSystematics}. %In the extraction of the final results by the profile likelihood fit described later in Section~\ref{sec:ResultsStats}, the background predictions are allowed to vary within the size of the systematic uncertainties and are further constrained by data.
