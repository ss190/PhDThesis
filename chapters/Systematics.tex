\label{chap:Uncertainties}

\indent Systematic uncertainties can be separated into two categories, experimental uncertainties and theoretical uncertainties.  Experimental systematics result from uncertainties in physics object reconstruction, calibration, the understanding of the detectors and the amount of additional pile-up interactions.  Theoretical systematics result from uncertainties in PDFs, interaction scales, and theoretical calculations. Experimental uncertainties such as jet energy resolution are assumed to be 100 percent correlated across different background sources.  On the other hand, theoretical uncertainties are assumed to be uncorrelated from one another.  \\

\indent In general systematic uncertainties are parameterized as independent parameters with gaussian constraints.  These parameters are called ``nuisance'' parameters and normally denoted by the symbol $\alpha$.  The systematic errors on backgrounds are evaluated through a simultaneous fit to the control and signal regions.  An estimate of the systematic uncertainties on backgrounds in the signal region can be made by fitting to the control region alone and extrapolating the result to the signal region.  It is important to note that the fit can also lead to correlations between initially independent systematics uncertainties. \\

%\indent The amount of MC background in both the control and signal regions will vary with experimental and theoretical systematics before the fit.  However after the fit the total amount of background will be normalized to the control region.  If the MC yield for background has a downward variation for a given systematic then the normalization scale factor will increase.  The increased normalization scale factor will compensate for the simultaneous drop in the signal region MC yield.  This partial cancelation of fluctuations between control region and signal region can lead to smaller systematic uncertainties.  In effect, the control region reduces systematic uncertainty by directly measuring the amount of background in data instead of relying solely on MC simulations.\\

%If the background prediction varies in the same way in the control region and the signal region the total systematic in the signal region is partially canceled out in the transfer factor.  

\indent A control region that is kinematically similar to the signal region leads to cancelations of systematic uncertainties.  Because of this, designing a control region that is kinematically similar to the signal region is crucial to mitigating systematic uncertainties.  More detail on control region design and systematic uncertainties can be found in chapter \ref{sec:Bkg:Tech} on background estimation and chapter \ref{chap:statistics} on statistical analysis.  \\

%\indent The fit may compensate for a change in one systematic by varying several other systematics in order to get the best fit in the control region.  The correlation matrix between a reduced set of systematic variations and background scale factor after the simultaneous fit to all control regions are given in figure \ref{figure.corrMatrix}.

%\indent The fit can also lead to correlations between systematics that are initially parameterized as independent nuisance parameters before the fit to the control region.    The scale factor $\mu$ is the amount that the expected background MC must be scaled up/down by so that data and MC yields agree in the control region.  \\

\indent The total background systematic uncertainty is $\sim20\%$ in the signal region.  The dominant background systematic uncertainties in the first four signal region $\RISR$ bins, between $0.3 < \RISR < 0.7$, include uncertainty on the $\ttbar$ ISR/FSR, uncertainty on the $\ttbar$ matrix element and parton shower calculation, and uncertainty on the jet energy resolution.  Each of these dominant systematic uncertainties contributes 5-10\% to the total uncertainty on background rate in the signal region.  The theoretical uncertainty on the amount of interference between SM $\ttbar$ and single top at NLO is also significant.  \\

\indent The large systematic uncertainty in the highest $\RISR$ bin between $0.7-0.8$ is completely due to low MC statistics caused by the low expected yield.  However the $0.7-0.8$ $\RISR$ region is completely statistically dominated for the same reason, with only 0.7 expected background events.  \\

\indent The dominant background uncertainties in each signal region bin is given in Table \ref{table.results.bkgestimate.uncertainties.SRC1_SRC2_SRC3}. \\% and \ref{table.results.bkgestimate.uncertainties.SRC4_SRC5}.  \\

\indent The post background only fit pull is given in Figure \ref{figure.pullPlot}.  All nuisance parameters, $\alpha$, are close to zero with uncertainties close to plus/minus one.  No profiling of any systematics is observed. \\

All nuisance parameters ($\alpha$) are close to zero after the fit with a fit uncertainty close to plus/minus 1.  No profiling of any systematics is observed.  The background normalization factors to background control regions, $\mu$, are also shown.  Most background normalization factors are statistically consistent with the nominal value of 1.0 but mu\_ttbarC, the $\ttbar$ normalization in the $\ttbar$+hard ISR control region, has a central value of 0.707 and is inconsistent with 1.0.  This is because the $\ttbar$ MC overestimates the amount of $\ttbar$+hard ISR.   }
