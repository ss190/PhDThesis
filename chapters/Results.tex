\indent Unblinded signal region distributions of the kinematic variables with the most discrimination power are shown in Figure \ref{fig:SRCUnblined}.  The expected background yield have been normalized to all control regions using the background only fitting procedure described in section \ref{sec:stat:bkgonly}.  \\

\indent Signal region yields with $\intlumi$ $\ifb$ of data can be seen in Table \ref{table.bkgonly.SRC1to3}.  No significant excess is observed in any region.  An under fluctuation of background is observed in the $\RISR$ bin between $0.6-0.7$ but is not statistically significant due to the low amount of expected events.  \\

\indent 95 percent upper confidence limits on the observed cross-section ($\langle\epsilon\sigma\rangle_{\rm obs}^{95}$) and on the number of signal events ($S_{\rm obs}^{95}$) in each $\RISR$ bin is shown in Table \ref{table.results.exclxsec.pval.upperlimit}.  The observed signal cross-section is defined as the number of signal events predicted to exist in SR for any particular signal model and is equivalent to selection efficiency times the signal production cross-section.  The limit on the observed cross-section is completely theory independent.  It is simply a statement on the maximum additional BSM rate that can exist in the signal region without being ruled out to 95 percent confidence. \\

\indent Observed limits are derived using the discovery fit procedure described in section \ref{sec:stat:discovery}.  Discovery p-values are calculated using the asymptotic high statistics assumption.  \\
