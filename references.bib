The reconstruction of electron and photon energies is optimised using multivariate algorithms. The response of the calorimeter layers is equalised in data and simulation, and the longitudinal profile of the electromagnetic showers is exploited to estimate the passive material in front of the calorimeter and reoptimise the detector simulation.

  abstract={The area of a jet is a measure of its susceptibility to radiation, like pileup or underlying event (UE), that on average, in the jet's neighbourhood, is uniform in rapidity and azimuth. In this article we establish a theoretical grounding for the discussion of jet areas, introducing two main definitions, passive and active areas, which respectively characterise the sensitivity to pointlike or diffuse pileup and UE radiation. We investigate the properties of jet areas for three standard jet algorithms, k t , Cambridge/Aachen and SISCone. Passive areas for single-particle jets are equal to the naive geometrical expectation π R 2 , but acquire an anomalous dimension at higher orders in the coupling, calculated here at leading order. The more physically relevant active areas differ from π R 2 even for single-particle jets, substantially so in the case of the cone algorithms like SISCone with a Tevatron Run-II split-merge procedure. We compare our results with direct measures of areas in parton-shower Monte Carlo simulations and find good agreement with the main features of the analytical predictions. We furthermore justify the use of jet areas to subtract the contamination from pileup.}

  abstract={The ATLAS Level-1 Calorimeter Trigger uses reduced-granularity information from all the ATLAS calorimeters to search for high transverse-energy electrons, photons, τ leptons and jets, as well as high missing and total transverse energy. The calorimeter trigger electronics has a fixed latency of about 1 μs, using programmable custom-built digital electronics. This paper describes the Calorimeter Trigger hardware, as installed in the ATLAS electronics cavern.}

  abstract={A new generation of parton distribution functions with increased precision and quantitative estimates of uncertainties is presented. This work significantly extends previous CTEQ and other global analyses on two fronts: (i) a full treatment of available experimental correlated systematic errors for both new and old data sets; (ii) a systematic and pragmatic treatment of uncertainties of the parton distributions and their physical predictions, using a recently developed eigenvector-basis approach to the hessian method. The new gluon distribution is considerably harder than that of previous standard fits. A number of physics issues, particularly relating to the behavior of the gluon distribution, are addressed in more quantitative terms than before. Extensive results on the uncertainties of parton distributions at various scales, and on parton luminosity functions at the Tevatron RunII and the LHC, are presented. The latter provide the means to quickly estimate the uncertainties of a wide range of physical processes at these high-energy hadron colliders, based on current knowledge of the parton distributions. In particular, the uncertainties on the production cross sections of the W , Z at the Tevatron and the LHC are estimated to be ±4% and ±5%, respectively, and that of a light Higgs at the LHC to be ±5%.}

abstract="We present NNPDF3.0, the first set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) determined with a methodology validated by a closure test. NNPDF3.0 uses a global dataset including HERA-II deep-inelastic inclusive cross-sections, the combined HERA charm data, jet production from ATLAS and CMS, vector boson rapidity and transverse momentum distributions from ATLAS, CMS and LHCb, W +c data from CMS and top quark pair production total cross sections from ATLAS and CMS. Results are based on LO, NLO and NNLO QCD theory and also include electroweak corrections. To validate our methodology, we show that PDFs determined from pseudo-data generated from a known underlying law correctly reproduce the statistical distributions expected on the basis of the assumed experimental uncertainties. This closure test ensures that our methodological uncertainties are negligible in comparison to the generic theoretical and experimental uncertainties of PDF determination. This enables us to determine with confidence PDFs at different perturbative orders and using a variety of experimental datasets ranging from HERA-only up to a global set including the latest LHC results, all using precisely the same validated methodology. We explore some of the phenomenological implications of our results for the upcoming 13 TeV Run of the LHC, in particular for Higgs production cross-sections.

	Abstract = {HistFitter is a software framework for statistical data analysis that has been used extensively in the ATLAS Collaboration to analyze data of proton-proton collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Most notably, HistFitter has become a de-facto standard in searches for supersymmetric particles since 2012, with some usage for Exotic and Higgs boson physics. HistFitter coherently combines several statistics tools in a programmable and flexible framework that is capable of bookkeeping hundreds of data models under study using thousands of generated input histograms. HistFitter interfaces with the statistics tools HistFactory and RooStats to construct parametric models and to perform statistical tests of the data, and extends these tools in four key areas. The key innovations are to weave the concepts of control, validation and signal regions into the very fabric of HistFitter, and to treat these with rigorous methods. Multiple tools to visualize and interpret the results through a simple configuration interface are also provided.},
