  abstract={A new generation of parton distribution functions with increased precision and quantitative estimates of uncertainties is presented. This work significantly extends previous CTEQ and other global analyses on two fronts: (i) a full treatment of available experimental correlated systematic errors for both new and old data sets; (ii) a systematic and pragmatic treatment of uncertainties of the parton distributions and their physical predictions, using a recently developed eigenvector-basis approach to the hessian method. The new gluon distribution is considerably harder than that of previous standard fits. A number of physics issues, particularly relating to the behavior of the gluon distribution, are addressed in more quantitative terms than before. Extensive results on the uncertainties of parton distributions at various scales, and on parton luminosity functions at the Tevatron RunII and the LHC, are presented. The latter provide the means to quickly estimate the uncertainties of a wide range of physical processes at these high-energy hadron colliders, based on current knowledge of the parton distributions. In particular, the uncertainties on the production cross sections of the W , Z at the Tevatron and the LHC are estimated to be ±4% and ±5%, respectively, and that of a light Higgs at the LHC to be ±5%.}

abstract="We present NNPDF3.0, the first set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) determined with a methodology validated by a closure test. NNPDF3.0 uses a global dataset including HERA-II deep-inelastic inclusive cross-sections, the combined HERA charm data, jet production from ATLAS and CMS, vector boson rapidity and transverse momentum distributions from ATLAS, CMS and LHCb, W +c data from CMS and top quark pair production total cross sections from ATLAS and CMS. Results are based on LO, NLO and NNLO QCD theory and also include electroweak corrections. To validate our methodology, we show that PDFs determined from pseudo-data generated from a known underlying law correctly reproduce the statistical distributions expected on the basis of the assumed experimental uncertainties. This closure test ensures that our methodological uncertainties are negligible in comparison to the generic theoretical and experimental uncertainties of PDF determination. This enables us to determine with confidence PDFs at different perturbative orders and using a variety of experimental datasets ranging from HERA-only up to a global set including the latest LHC results, all using precisely the same validated methodology. We explore some of the phenomenological implications of our results for the upcoming 13 TeV Run of the LHC, in particular for Higgs production cross-sections.

@article{HistFitter,
	Abstract = {HistFitter is a software framework for statistical data analysis that has been used extensively in the ATLAS Collaboration to analyze data of proton-proton collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Most notably, HistFitter has become a de-facto standard in searches for supersymmetric particles since 2012, with some usage for Exotic and Higgs boson physics. HistFitter coherently combines several statistics tools in a programmable and flexible framework that is capable of bookkeeping hundreds of data models under study using thousands of generated input histograms. HistFitter interfaces with the statistics tools HistFactory and RooStats to construct parametric models and to perform statistical tests of the data, and extends these tools in four key areas. The key innovations are to weave the concepts of control, validation and signal regions into the very fabric of HistFitter, and to treat these with rigorous methods. Multiple tools to visualize and interpret the results through a simple configuration interface are also provided.},
